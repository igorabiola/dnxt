 Building
----------

LuaTimer is composed by a C library (which gets the OS time) and a Lua part.

To build the C library:

(i) Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X
  1.  Go to 'unix' directory. 

  2.  If Lua 5.1 headers are not in the default system path: open 'Makefile', 
      uncomment the variable LUAINC, and set the path to the directory that
      contains the headers.

  2.1 Under Mac OS X, set the MACOSX_VERSION variable according your system.

  3. Use the command 'make' and the target system:
      - make linux               , or
      - make bsd                 , or
      - make macosx
 
(ii) Windows
  1. Use the project for Visual C++ in the 'windows' directory.

---
 Intalling
-----------

Copy the C library ('luatimer.dll' or 'luatimer.so') to some place in your
LUA_CPATH, and the file 'luatimer.lua' to some place in your LUA_PATH.
